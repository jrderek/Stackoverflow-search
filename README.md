# Stackoverflow-search

1. The problem statement

In this project i have to develop stack overflow search engine based on semantic meaning so when user search any question on search engine then it should give relevant and and semantically most similar results

2. Business Problem

Stackoverflow has a huge amount of data due to which it’s difficult to search for a solution because when we search any on stack overflow then it gives results based on keyword we have used . 

It’s not hard to get desired results for a programmer guy because he/she knows technical terms but for a non programmer guy this poses a great concern. Objective of this project is to understand the content of what the user is trying to search for and then return most similar results based on semantic meaning. 

The idea is to represent question in vector space and compare question based on similarity or distance between these features.

3 Business Constraints

Low latency Requirement.
Search engine should display Most relevant result.
3. Machine Learning Problem

We have to Build Search engine based on semantic meaning of content and display results in minimum time .
